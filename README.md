OCTranspoGPSForMyLocation
=========================


----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are already many nice applications to track Ottawa buses, 
but I couldn't find any apps that allow us to search more than one bus route at the same time. 

So, I created this for my convenience. There is still a lot to add and fix.



Click the bus icon.

Press Search by your location.

Press the my location button on the top right corner. (It will get your location without pressing the button, but it takes time.) Press a bus stop marker.

Select bus routes and press the Search button.
