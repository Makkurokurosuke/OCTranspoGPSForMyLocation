OCTranspoGPSForMyLocation
=========================


----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are already many nice applications to track Ottawa buses, 
but I couldn't find any apps that allow us to search more than one bus route at the same time. 

So, I created this for my convenience. There is still a lot to add and fix.

Press the my location button on the top right corner (It will get your location without pressing the button, but it takes time.) Press a bus top marker.

Select but routes and press the Search button.
